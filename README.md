# MSMQ-App
Simple Microsoft Message Queuing Services (MSMQ) in C# .Net


Distributed applications run on two or more computers. 
******************************************************

Distributed applications communicate with one another by passing data over machine boundaries through appropriate network protocols. 
Most of these protocols use synchronous technologies, such as Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and DCOM. 
The synchronous process model has a number of limitations, however. 

Message queuing provides an asynchronous programming model and a loosely coupled environment for different components of distributed applications.
